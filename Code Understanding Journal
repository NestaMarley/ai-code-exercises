PROMPT 1; Understanding How Specific Features Work.

✅ Files Related to Task Creation

📌(models.py)

Main components involved:

-Task class

Fields for title, description, priority, status

Metadata fields: id, created_at, updated_at, completed_at

Tags list

-Enums

TaskStatus → tracks lifecycle (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, REVIEW, DONE)

TaskPriority → shows  task urgency (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)

>.Execution flow of task creation. 

1.)Developer instantiates a Task object

task = Task("Title", "Desc", TaskPriority.MEDIUM)


2.)Constructor sets:

Default status: TODO

Default timestamps: created_at & updated_at = now

Empty tags list

3.)The created task is returned to be stored in local or remote storage systems

>.How data is stored / retrieved

Tasks are in-memory objects in tests

The system likely stores them as dictionaries keyed by task.id
Example in test:

local_tasks = {"task1": self.task1}


Storage layer is abstracted away (not shown)

>.

✅ Domain Model Pattern

The Task class encapsulates business logic and state

✅ Enum for state safety

Prevents invalid statuses or priorities

✅ Files Related to Task Status Updates

📌 (task_list_merge.py)

-Main components involved

merge_task_lists(local_tasks, remote_tasks)

Syncs two task lists from different sources

Produces:

merged dict of tasks

lists of tasks that need actions:

create locally

create remotely

update locally

update remotely

resolve_task_conflict(local_task, remote_task)

Compares updated_at timestamps

Resolves status differences:

A DONE status always wins

Merges tags (no duplication)

Returns:

merged task object

whether local needs update

whether remote needs update

.>Execution flow of a task update

1.)Detect task exists in both local & remote lists

2.)Compare modification times:

Newest update decides main fields

3.)If either version is DONE:

Completed one takes priority

4.)Merge tags → deduplicate list

5.)Set action flags:

update_local if local is outdated

update_remote if remote is outdated

6.)Return merged result to be persisted as needed

->.How data is stored / retrieved

Tasks are tracked in dict-like structures

{ task_id: Task }

Merge returns instructions, not database actions:

Separation of sync logic vs. storage logic

>>Interesting Design Patterns.

| Pattern                          | Where                               | Why it matters                             
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ 
| Conflict Resolution Strategy| `resolve_task_conflict`             | Custom rules (timestamps + completed wins) 
| Two-Way Sync Algorithm     | `merge_task_lists`                  | Handles offline/online synchronization     
| Command Pattern (implicit)  | Output lists like `to_update_local` | Defers execution of actual DB operations   
| Immutable Merge Output      | New `merged_task` returned          | Prevents accidental state mutation         


models.py              task_list_merge.py
------------          --------------------
Task() created   →    merge_task_lists() detects source of truth
TaskStatus enum   →    resolve_task_conflict() applies business logic
TaskPriority enum →    output queued changes for storage layer


PROMPT 2: DEEPENED CODEBASE UNDERSTANDING (How Task Priorities Work.)

✅ 1️⃣ Initial Understanding vs What I Discovered

>.Initial Understanding

-Priority would simply mean HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW

-Sorting tasks mostly rely on priority field alone

-Status and due dates would not affect priority much

>.What I Discovered

-Priority is just one aspect  in the task’s final importance score

-Scoring is actually multi-dimensional

Factors include:
✅ Priority value
✅ Due date urgency
✅ Task status (penalties)
✅ Tags (boosts)
✅ Recent updates (boosts)

➡️ Priority influences but does not guarantee a task is top-ranked


| Guided Question                    |  Answer                                                  | Insight Gained                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Does HIGH priority always win?     | No — a MEDIUM task due today might outrank it.                 | Due dates can outweigh priority.           |
| What happens if a task is DONE?    | Score gets reduced by 50 points.                          | Completed tasks always drop in importance. |
| Do tags matter?                    | Yes — blocker, critical, urgent tags give +8 points. | Certain tags can boost urgency.            |
| Does being updated recently help?  | Yes — updates < 1 day ago give +5 points.                  | Recent changes increase relevance.         |
| What if a task is overdue?         | It gets +35 points.                                        | Overdue tasks skyrocket to the top.        |
| Does priority have numeric values? | Yes — LOW=1, MEDIUM=2, HIGH=4, URGENT=6 (then ×10).            | Priority → weighted scoring system.        |


✅ Priority Score Formula.
Base Score = priority_weight × 10  
Then add/subtract other factors.
So:

-URGENT = 6 × 10 = 60 base score

-HIGH = 40

-MEDIUM = 20

-LOW = 10

➡️ A SINGLE overdue day (+35) can override priority differences completely.

✅ 3️⃣ Misconceptions That Got Clarified.

| What I Thought                         | What’s Actually True                                   
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ 
| Priority alone determines ordering     | It’s only one of many scoring factors                  
| Completed tasks still stay in the list | Completed tasks are pushed to the bottom           
| Tags are just labels                   | Some tags meaningfully increase urgency                
| Due dates are optional                 | Due dates dramatically change ranking                  
| Status doesn’t affect scoring          | Status can make a task irrelevant (big score drop) 

KEY TAKEAWAY;

Task importance isn’t just priority.
It’s a formula that decides what you should focus on RIGHT NOW.

📌 Highest scoring tasks = most urgent + most important + most recently touched
📌 Completed tasks = lowest priority
📌 Overdue tasks = emergency
